# Music-Store-SQL-Project
I recently completed an SQL project based on a Music Store database. The goal was to explore the data and find meaningful business insights using SQL queries.

In this project, I analyzed different aspects of the store like finding the senior most employee, identifying the country and city with the most sales, and discovering who the best customer is. I also explored which artists created the most Rock music, which customers listen to Rock, and which songs are longer than the average length.

Through this project, I got hands on experience using SQL for real world data analysis. I learned how to write complex queries involving joins, grouping, sorting, and subqueries to extract insights from large datasets.

Overall, this project helped me understand how SQL can turn raw data into useful business information whether itâ€™s identifying top performing artists or understanding customer purchase patterns.
